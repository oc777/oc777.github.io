description: CSS preprocessors or how to make your life easier.

Wow. __CSS preprocessors!__ It is an amazing tool for a woman designing a website. Yes, we _(women)_ like to change our mind a lot,
so all these variables came real handy when I decided for the 20th time to change font, has tried 10 different color mixes
and stuff like that... I think it also becomes much easier to put a new "skin" on the old project and pretend like you did
everything from scratch ;) Not that this blog is the case, since this is actually my first encounter with CSS preprocessors.
But in the future I definitely going to take advantage of this tool!

In this project I used Sass _(very sassy name btw)_  with SCSS syntax. The default Sass syntax is a little hard for me to read
and to find things. I find that curly braces help me to distinguish easier between blocks of code. However, I might get lazy in the future and
stop using the braces...

I must admit though that it becomes a little harder with CSS preprocessor to find out where exactly you made a mistake in
your style sheet (and in which one). Hence a little harder to fix it.
