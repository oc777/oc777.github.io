description: Let's talk about static site generators!
---

If you are after a simple website without databases and functionality, then static site generators are something you should try.
I really liked that you can build separate blocks like headers and menus and then just include them into your web pages.
So if you want to update the contact information in the footer of your website, you have to change it only n one place.
Yay!

However, when there are platforms out there like WordPress, Joomla and such, it becomes quite strange that somebody would
actually consider getting into Jekyll. Maybe just out of pure curiosity or to get some practice developing for the web.
